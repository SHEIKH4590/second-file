    <h1> Cooking weights and measures</h1>
    <p> <i>In recipes, quantities of ingredients may be specified by mass (<b>commonly called weight</b>), by volume, or by count.</i></p>
    <P>For most of history, most cookbooks did not specify<br>
         quantities precisely, instead talking of "a nice leg of<br>
          spring lamb", a "cupful" of lentils, a piece of butter "the<br>
           size of a small apricot", and "sufficient" salt.[1] Informal<br>
           measurements such as a "pinch", a "drop", or a "hint"<br>
            (soupçon) continue to be used from time to time. In the<br>
             US, Fannie Farmer introduced the more exact<br>
              specification of quantities by volume in her 1896<i> Boston<br>
               Cooking-School Cook Book</i>

    <p>To day, most of the world prefers metric measurement by<br>
         weight,[3] though the preference for volume<br>
          measurements continues among home cooks in the<br>
           United States[4][5] and the rest of North America.<br>
            Different ingredients are measured in different ways:

    <p>
        In most of the world, recipes use the metric system of units—litres (L) and millilitres (mL), grams (g)<br>
         and kilograms (kg), and degrees Celsius (°C). The official spelling litre is used in most English-speaking<br> nations; the notable exception is the United States where the spelling liter is preferred
